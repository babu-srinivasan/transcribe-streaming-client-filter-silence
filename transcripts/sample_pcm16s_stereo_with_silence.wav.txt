00:00:00.510 00:00:01.040 - used car. 
00:00:02.375 00:00:02.735 - Yeah, 
00:00:03.125 00:00:04.245 - Hi, um. 
00:00:05.165 00:00:10.955 - My name is Viola. I just left I'm actually still in your parking lot. 
00:00:12.745 00:00:13.335 - Uh-huh. 
00:00:21.045 00:00:21.645 - Oh, 
00:00:12.005 00:00:23.985 - Um, and I was pulling the car I just bought out and I, I bumped into that low wall outside of your front door and like it dented the back fender of my car. 
00:00:24.645 00:00:25.335 - Um, 
00:00:24.085 00:00:25.355 - Oh, no. 
00:00:28.645 00:00:29.395 - Yeah. 
00:00:31.085 00:00:31.445 - Right. 
00:00:42.325 00:00:43.135 - OK. 
00:00:26.025 00:00:51.545 - Yeah, like I've had it for like 15 minutes, um, but like it sucks and I wanna know if I can talk to somebody because there's like no warning for that back wall. There's like no um like what do you call those things in a parking lot to stop you from like hitting things or whatever like there's nothing and it seems like a really bad like it's set up just really sucky and like I'm not paying like I'm not paying for this pair, but I'm not leaving without it getting repaired, so. 
00:00:52.415 00:00:53.045 - Yeah 
00:00:52.005 00:00:53.205 - OK, um, 
00:00:54.005 00:00:55.355 - Got it. Uh, 
00:00:56.245 00:00:57.205 - So 
00:00:57.905 00:01:11.645 - I'm not exactly sure um who you want me to put you through to I'm happy to get you um the number of the tow service that could come and handle the car. Is it still drivable or is it? 
00:01:12.885 00:01:13.575 - OK. 
00:01:10.825 00:01:16.265 - Uh, no, it's still drivable. It just has like a big ugly ass like gash on it like it's like. 
00:01:15.605 00:01:17.955 - Yeah, OK, I got it. 
00:01:17.205 00:01:34.685 - No, I wanna talk to like the manager, the owner, whoever like you can't just like have a lot like in a car dealership like have a wall that you can literally back into like super easy with like no like there's no reflectors on it, like there's no nothing, and I'm like hit it and I literally just like paid in cash for this car. 
00:01:35.285 00:01:36.035 - So 
00:01:35.425 00:01:36.765 - Yeah, um. 
00:01:37.925 00:01:49.595 - Well, I can pass that information along and um someone can review it and maybe uh in the future they could install reflectors or something like that or maybe they'll. 
00:02:00.965 00:02:01.715 - Yeah, 
00:02:07.285 00:02:08.035 - Um, 
00:01:50.015 00:02:08.335.00000000001455 - Um, change, change the, the way that the, the wall is set up in the parking lot so that this doesn't happen in the future. I'm happy to pass that information um along for you um can I get a little bit more information about uh what happened just because they're just gonna watch all the pieces. So what was your name, ma'am? 
00:02:08.664.9999999999854 00:02:11.105 - Yeah, OK, um, Viola. 
00:02:11.365 00:02:13.435 - Viola, OK, and your last name? 
00:02:12.835 00:02:13.415 - Viola. 
00:02:14.225 00:02:17.515 - Now at N E L L E. 
00:02:17.925 00:02:20.165 - OK, perfect. And um. 
00:02:19.565 00:02:20.355 - And 
00:02:21.205 00:02:25.285 - The, the car that you purchased today, what, uh, what car was that? 
00:02:26.005 00:02:27.385 - Um, yeah, so 
00:02:31.525 00:02:32.455 - Mhm. OK. 
00:02:27.445 00:02:32.515 - I just bought the um Mercedes E Class. 
00:02:32.885 00:02:34.135 - Yep, got you. 
00:02:33.145 00:02:34.485 - It's um 
00:02:34.645 00:02:36.955 - And uh it's goal. 
00:02:38.345 00:02:39.395 - Uh-huh, OK. 
00:02:48.695 00:02:48.705 - Right. 
00:02:50.005 00:02:50.795 - OK. 
00:02:56.485 00:02:57.175 - Yeah. 
00:02:38.005 00:03:07.215 - And um I was just trying to like leave like the parking lot and like even you have to like do that little like funky pull out like 27 point turn or whatever it is like outside of the front door and like you can't see like I can't see um so like it's great if you like if they put in some sort of like reflectors or like something like in the cement but it's like I don't know something like pick up so that if you're like not 7 ft tall, you can see it, but 
00:03:09.765 00:03:10.525 - Yeah. 
00:03:08.085 00:03:20.115 - Like it's too late for my car now and so that's why like I'm super annoyed like I wanna give you guys a good review like I wanna be like all nice about it and everything, but like I'm not gonna go home with this brand new car I just bought with like a big gash on the back. 
00:03:20.985 00:03:22.075 - Like that's a stop 
00:03:21.055 00:03:25.615 - OK, absolutely, yeah, that is really unfortunate, um, 
00:03:26.405 00:03:27.055 - Uh 
00:03:27.615 00:03:28.005 - Just 
00:03:48.775 00:03:48.785 - Uh 
00:03:28.385 00:03:52.705 - Just so I fully understand and I can pass it along correctly, um, did you adjust the mirrors for yourself before you um pulled out with the car. I know sometimes the mirrors can all be set differently if someone else drove it before you purchased it and did the mirrors all look good and and you could see everything out of your rearview and your side mirrors because usually that's where you can kind of see that wall a little bit better, um, so I'm just curious. 
00:03:56.325 00:03:57.015 - OK. 
00:03:57.845 00:03:58.715 - OK. 
00:03:51.925 00:04:00.575 - Uh-huh, yeah, yeah, no, I honestly, I don't even know like it, but it shouldn't matter like I just, I mean like yeah sure I'll do that and like thank you for like. 
00:04:08.645 00:04:09.345 - Um 
00:04:01.045 00:04:09.855 - Driving 101 but like really I just need to talk to like is there a manager in is the owner in like whatever like Mr. Mercedes, like whoever is in charge. 
00:04:14.645 00:04:15.295 - OK. 
00:04:10.165 00:04:16.615 - Yeah, uh, just give me one second here and I'll see if I can put you through to the manager, OK? Just I'm just gonna put you on hold for just one second, OK? 
00:04:16.774.9999999999709 00:04:17.855.0000000000291 - Sure, yeah, OK.

00:04:39.925 00:04:40.325 - Yes 
00:04:41.205 00:04:41.685 - OK. 
00:04:43.065 00:04:43.615 - Sure. 
00:04:23.845 00:04:46.145 - OK, so, um, I am going to put you through to um the head of the um cosmetics like repairs department and um he'll see like if he can just pop on out and have a look at the car and then we'll go from there, OK? And I have all this information down so I'm just gonna go ahead and um put you on through to him now, OK? 
00:04:46.645 00:04:49.805 - Yeah, OK, alright, OK, um, thanks, thanks a lot. 
00:04:49.685 00:04:51.395 - OK, OK, have a good one. 
00:04:52.005 00:04:52.505 - OK.
